# 16xify
Welcome to 16xify!

This is a tool for rescaling a 4x farming simulator map to a 16x map.
Currently, this tool only supports png files and only supports going from 4x to 16x.
The tool was written with this specific purpose in mind for SeriousMods.

I may extend this tool later to support both up and downscaling and to support the other files necessary.

Operation instructions.
1) Go to the releases folder and download the .zip file
2) Extract the .zip file
4) Drag all the png files you want extended to the png folder
5) Run the 16xify.exe file
6) Select the location you would like the old map to be in relation to the new map using numbers 1-5 in accordance with the menu
7) Return the png files to your map and continue editing as normal.

Feel free to fork and add to this tool if you desire. The source code is in the sources folder.
Submit a pull request with a working update if you wish, I will check and accept them as I have time.
